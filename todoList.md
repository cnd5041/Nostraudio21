Priorities:
** === done

**-Convert to new version of Firebase (Angular Fire 5)

- Unique portfolio names
- Do search so that I'm favoring firebase over spotify
- Create artist?
 - Periodically update info from Spotify
- Error Handeling
- Viewing other portolios
  - friends
    Relationships: See Friends and their portfolios. See artists that they own, artists you have in common, 
        on artists page show friends that own this artist..
        - Future alert that someone followed you

- Create a cloud function that calculates the artist price (when the artist is updated and when a 
 child is pushed to the stockholders)
   - Create alerts for movement on stock prices with the cloud functions (or other events)
- Events: Use Image Photos: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search (look at wikipedia)
- Fix Support and Login (make sure login is not just mocked)
- Figure out deployment (firebase, in offline example), multiple instances, secure key storage
